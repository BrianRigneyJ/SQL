# SQL
This project creates a relational database consisting of multiple tables meant to mimic a library. There are tables for books, authors, clients (those borrowing books), and a table to keep track of the actual borrowing.

In this project I create the database and tables, load sample data, then write some queries to analyze the data.

This was created using MySql version 8.0.12 for Mac OS, along with MySQLWorkbench.
