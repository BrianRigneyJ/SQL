# SQL
This project creates a simple relational database consisting of multiple tables meant to mimic a library. There are tables for books, authors, clients (those borrowing books), and a table to keep track of the actual borrowing. This was created with MySql version 8.0.12 for Mac OS.

In this project I create the database abd tables, and then do some queries to analyze the data. I have also included the sample data I loaded.
